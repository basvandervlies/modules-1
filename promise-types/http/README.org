* http promise type

** Synopsis

- /Name/: =http=
- /Version/: =1.0.0=
- /Description/: Perform HTTP(S) requests from policy.

** Promiser and attributes

The promiser can either be a URL of the request or, if the /url/ attribute is
used (see below), it can be an arbitrary string. All attributes are optional if
the URL is specified in the promiser.

*** Attributes

| Name       | Type                        | Description                                                                                                                                                      | Mandatory | Default    |
|------------+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+------------|
| =url=      | =string=                    | URL or the request (starting with "http://" or "https://")                                                                                                       | No        | /promiser/ |
| =file=     | =string=                    | File system path for where to save the response (body).                                                                                                          | No        | -          |
| =method=   | =string=                    | HTTP method of the request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE or PATCH)                                                                                                     | No        | -          |
| =headers=  | =string=, =slist= or =data= | headers to send with the request (=data= with key-value pairs, =slist= with colon-separated key-value pairs, or =string= with key:value pairs) on separate lines | No        | -          |
| =payload=  | =string= or =data=          | data payload to send with the request (=string= or =data= that will be converted to a string); /@\/some\/path/ values can be used to send file-based payloads    | No        | -          |
| =insecure= | =string=                    | Whether to skip TLS validation of the server's certificate (/"true"/) or not (/"false"/)                                                                         | No        | /"false"/  |


** Result classes
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: result-classes
   :END:

On success, each /http/ promise defines a class that is in the form of
~$(this.promiser)_METHOD_request_done~. On failure, class of form
~$(this.promiser)_METHOD_request_failed~ is defined plus classes of form:

- ~$(this.promiser)_METHOD_payload_failed~ (payload-related failures)
- ~$(this.promiser)_METHOD_payload_file_failed~ (file-based payload failures)
- ~$(this.promiser)_METHOD_payload_conversion_failed~ (payload conversion failures)
- ~$(this.promiser)_METHOD_file_failed~ (/file/-related failures, see above)

in the respective cases. There are currently no special classes for HTTP
response codes, only the ~$(this.promiser)_METHOD_request_failed~ class is
defined in case the response code is not an OK code.

*The promiser is canonified in all the above classes.*


** Examples

#+BEGIN_SRC cf3
bundle agent __main__
{
  http:
    "https://cfengine.com/images/cfengine-logo.svg"
      file => "/var/cfengine/cfengine-logo.svg",
      if => not(fileexists("/var/cfengine/cfengine-logo.svg"));
  }
#+END_SRC

** Drawbacks and TODOs

The current implementation of the module *is not idempotent* and so a request is
made every time a promise of the /http/ promise type is evaluated. [[#result-classes][Result
classes]] can be used to ensure the request is only made once.

*** TODO TODO [4/8]

- [X] /insecure/ attribute
- [X] /payload/ of type =data= should result in the ~Content-Type:
      application/json~ added to /headers/
- [X] ~@/some/file/path~ special values for POST/PUT requests
- [X] result classes to allow idempotency without locking
- [ ] progress reporting if response ~Content-Lenght~ is big
- [ ] /GET/ requests should not overwrite data if it is the same
- [ ] /checksum/ attribute
- [ ] result classes for /4xx/, /5xx/,... failure response codes
