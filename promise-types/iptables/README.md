Its important to note that some attributes have their own validation requirements. For example `destination_port` should expect `protocol` to be present.

## Examples

### Append rule to accept traffic from some IP

```cfengine3
bundle agent main
{
  iptables:
      "accept_cfengine_com"
        command => "append",
        chain => "INPUT",
        source => "34.107.174.45",
        target => "ACCEPT";
}
```

### Append a rule to drop traffic from telnet port

```cfengine3
bundle agent main
{
  iptables:
      "drop_telnet"
        command => "append",
        chain => "INPUT",
        protocol => "tcp",
        destination_port => 23,
        target => "DROP";
}
```

### Insert a rule to accept ssh port with high priority

```cfengine3
bundle agent main
{
  iptables:
      "accept_ssh"
        command => "insert",
        chain => "INPUT",
        protocol => "tcp",
        destination_port => 22,
        priority => 1,
        target => "ACCEPT";
}
```

### Delete a rule that accepts traffic from some IP

```cfengine3
bundle agent main
{
  iptables:
      "delete_accept_cfengine_com"
        command => "delete",
        chain => "INPUT",
        source => "34.107.174.45",
        target => "ACCEPT";
}
```

### Set an aggressive policy for incoming traffic

```cfengine3
bundle agent main
{
  iptables:
      "aggressive_policy"
        command => "policy",
        chain => "INPUT",
        target => "DROP";
}
```

### Flush a specific filter chain

Flushing chains should be done primarily when the chains are _expected_ to stay flushed.

``` cfengine3
bundle agent main
{
  iptables:
      "flush_INPUT"
        command => "flush",
        chain => "INPUT";
}
```

### Flush all filter chains

```cfengine3
bundle agent main
{
  iptables:
      "flush_all"
        command => "flush",
        chain => "ALL";
}
```

### Ensure only specific rules are present

```cfengine3
bundle common allow_cfengine_and_ssh
{
  vars:
    "rules" data => '{
      "accept_cfengine": {
        "table": "filter",
        "chain": "INPUT",
        "protocol": "tcp",
        "destination_port": 5308,
        "priority": 1,
        "target": "ACCEPT"
      },
      "accept_ssh": {
        "table": "filter",
        "chain": "INPUT",
        "protocol": "tcp",
        "destination_port": 22,
        "priority": 1,
        "target": "ACCEPT"
      },
    }';
}

bundle agent main
{
  iptables:
      "clean_non_cfengine_rules"
        command => "exclusive",
        rules => @{allow_cfengine_and_ssh.rules};
}
```

### Total CFEngine control

```cfengine3
bundle common allow_incoming_cfengine
{
  vars:
      "rules" data => '{
        "rule1": {
          "table": "filter",
          "chain": "INPUT",
          "protocol": "tcp",
          "destination_port": 5308,
          "priority": 1,
          "target": "ACCEPT"
        }
      }';
}

bundle agent main
{
  vars:
      "rules" data => @{allow_incoming_cfengine.rules};

  iptables:
      "clean_non_cfengine_rules"
        command => "exclusive",
        rules => @{rules};

      "aggressive_policy"
        command => "policy",
        chain => "INPUT",
        target => "DROP";

      "accept_cfengine_rule1"
        command => "insert",
        table => ${rules[rule1][table]},
        chain => ${rules[rule1][chain]},
        protocol => ${rules[rule1][protocol]},
        destination_port => ${rules[rule1][destination_port]},
        priority => ${rules[rule1][priority]},
        target => ${rules[rule1][target]};
}
```

## Notes

All rules added by the iptables custom promise will have a comment  signifing its priority. The `-m comment --comment` match will be used  with iptables. The comment follows the pattern `CF3:priority:X` where `X` is a number. That comment will be used as key for any  sorting/manipulating of the rules in a chain when evaluating the append/insert promises. Keeping a promise means that the rule was already inserted at the proper chain region according to its priority. Repairing a promise means changing the iptables rules, for example by inserting, removing, or moving a rule in the chain. If multiple rules have the same priority they the will be inserted one after the other making a block of same priority rules.
