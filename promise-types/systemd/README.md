## Examples

Make sure service named `myservice` is started:

```cfengine3
bundle agent main
{
  systemd:
    "myservice"
      name => "myservice",
      enabled => "true",
      state => "started";
}
```

Make sure a service `sample` running `sleep 86400` exists:

```cfengine3
bundle agent main
{
  systemd:
    "sample"
      masked => "false",
      enabled => "true",
      state => "started",
      unit_description => "My sample service",
      service_exec_start => {"/usr/bin/sleep 86400"},
      service_type => "simple",
      install_wanted_by => {"multi-user.target"};
}
```

Make sure the service namedÂ `sample` does not exist:

```cfengine3
bundle agent main
{
  systemd:
    "sample"
      state => "absent";
