The `groups` promise type helps managing local groups, letting you ensure some users are a part of a group, or excluded from a group, etc.

**Note**: This is an experimental version of a promise type, and may be changed in the future.

## Requirements

* Unix-like system.

## Examples

Present group `foo` including user `alice` and `bob`, but excluding user `malcom`:

```
@if minimum_version(3.20)
body members foo
{
  include => { "alice", "bob" };
  exclude => { "malcom" };
}
@endif

bundle agent main
{
  groups:
      "foo"
        policy => "present",
@if minimum_version(3.20)
        members => foo;
@else
        members => '{ "include": ["alice", "bob"],
                      "exclude": ["malcom"] }';
@endif
}
```

Present group `bar` with GID `123` including only user `alice`:

```
@if minimum_version(3.20)
body members bar
{
  only => { "alice" };
}
@endif

bundle agent main
{
  groups:
      "bar"
@if minimum_version(3.20)
        members => bar,
@else
        members => '{ "only": ["alice"] }',
@endif
        gid = 123;
}
```

Absent group `baz`:

```
bundle agent main
{
  groups:
      "baz"
        policy => "absent";
}
```
