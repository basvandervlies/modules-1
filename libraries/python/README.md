A library for CFEngine custom promise types implemented in Python.
It provides the `PromiseModule` base class and many helper values and mechanisms that facilitates creation of custom promises.

If you'd like to develop new promise types (or other modules) for CFEngine, we recommend finishing our getting started tutorial:

https://docs.cfengine.com/docs/3.21/getting-started.html

(The last part shows implementing your first module).

If you feel comfortable with using CFEngine and writing Python code already, there is a template project you can just copy and start editing:

For more detailed information about how custom promise types work, see our documentation:
